1. A local class type name can only be used in the enclosing function. For example, in the following program, declarations of t and tp are valid in fun(), but invalid in main().

2. All the methods of Local classes must be defined inside the class only. 

3. A Local class cannot contain static data members. It may contain static functions though. 

4. Member methods of local class can only access static and enum variables of the enclosing function. Non-static variables of the enclosing function are not accessible inside local classes.

5. Local classes can access global types, variables and functions. Also, local classes can access other local classes of same function.

In C++, a Copy Constructor may be called in following cases:
1. When an object of the class is returned by value.
2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument.
3. When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class.
4. When compiler generates a temporary object.
