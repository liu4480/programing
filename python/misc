10. pickle
Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. 
What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file. Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. 
The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.

13. NZEC Non Zero Exit Error
    Infinite Recursion or if you have run out of stack memory.
    Input and output both are NOT exactly same as the test cases.
    As the online platforms, test your program using a computer code which matches your output with the specified outputs exactly.
    This type of error is also shown when your program is performing basic programming mistakes like dividing by 0.
    Check for the values of your variables, they can be vulnerable to integer flow.

14. virtualenv
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use.
